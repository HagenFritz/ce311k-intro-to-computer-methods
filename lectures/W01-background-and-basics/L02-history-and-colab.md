## Evolution of Programming

### Slide 3: 1800s - Early Computing
<details>
<summary><i>See More</i></summary>

#### Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871)
- Known as the "Father of the Computer" for designing the **Analytical Engine**.
- Introduced the idea of a programmable machine that could handle any calculation.
- Though it was never built, Babbage’s design included memory, a processor, and even control flow.

#### Ada Lovelace (1815 - 1852)
- Recognized as the "First Programmer" for writing an algorithm for Babbage’s machine.
- Envisioned that computers could process things beyond numbers, like text and music.
- She wrote an algorithm to compute **Bernoulli numbers**, showing the Analytical Engine's potential.

#### The Analytical Engine
- A mechanical computer design with modern-like components:
  - **Mill** = CPU, which performs calculations
  - **Store** = Memory, which holds data
  - **Reader/Printer** = Input/Output for data entry and results
- Featured early programming concepts like loops and conditionals, which allowed complex calculations.
- Punched card input/output influenced later computing technology.

#### Alan Turing
- Created the concept of the **Turing Machine**, a model for a universal computer.
- Showed that one machine could handle any task with the right programming.
- Worked on cracking the Enigma code in WWII, demonstrating computing’s real-world applications.

#### Z3
- Built by Konrad Zuse in 1941 as the first fully programmable digital computer.
- Used binary (0s and 1s), similar to today’s computers.
- The Z3 was initially used for complex engineering calculations, like airplane design.

#### ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
- Completed in 1945, the ENIAC was the first fully electronic, general-purpose computer.
- Designed to compute artillery trajectories, it could calculate thousands of times faster than prior methods.
- This enormous machine used thousands of vacuum tubes and required a whole room.

#### Assembly
- Translated machine code into readable instructions, simplifying hardware control.
- Used directly by early programmers to manage memory and hardware.
- Assembly is still important in low-level programming, like operating systems and device drivers.

#### FORTRAN
- The first high-level language, created for scientists and engineers.
- Allowed users to focus on math operations instead of hardware details.
- Still popular today for high-performance scientific computing.

#### LISP
- Created for artificial intelligence research, introducing recursion (self-calling functions).
- Used in tasks that involve logical reasoning and processing symbols.
- One of the oldest languages still used, especially in AI research.

#### 1964: BASIC
- Designed for beginners and widely used in schools.
- Made programming more accessible and helped popularize computing.
- Many early programmers started with BASIC on home computers.

#### 1969: UNIX Operating System
- Established standards for operating systems, including multitasking and multi-user capabilities.
- Basis for many modern systems like Linux and macOS.
- Set a foundation for system design that remains influential.

#### 1972: C Language
- Flexible language that could directly access memory, widely used for system software.
- Inspired many later languages, including C++, Java, and Python.
- Often used in OS development and embedded systems.

#### Structured Programming Movement
- Introduced modular coding, loops, and functions for better organization.
- Emphasized clean, readable code and reliable structures.
- Principles still used today for writing and organizing code.

#### 1974: Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Created for managing data in relational databases.
- Made it easier to store, retrieve, and manipulate large datasets.
- SQL remains essential in database management and business applications.

#### IBM PC
- Released in 1981, making personal computing affordable and accessible.
- Sparked growth in software development for home and office use.
- Led to the expansion of computer use across industries.

#### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Concept of classes and objects, popularized by languages like **C++**.
- Made it easier to create complex, reusable code through concepts like inheritance.
- Forms the basis of most modern programming, used in software and app development.

#### Matlab
- Specialized in numerical computing and data visualization.
- Became popular in engineering and scientific fields for its ability to handle large datasets and calculations.
- Frequently used in research, especially for matrix and statistical operations.

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed interactive, dynamic websites.
- Made it possible to share information and applications globally.
- Paved the way for the modern internet and web-based applications.

#### Platform Independence (Java)
- Java’s "Write once, run anywhere" approach made cross-platform development easier.
- Programs could run on any device with Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Became popular for web applications and enterprise systems.

#### Open Source Movement
- Linux (OS) and Python (language) led the charge for open-source collaboration.
- Encouraged free, community-driven software development.
- Revolutionized software by promoting shared innovation and accessibility.
