#### Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871)
- Often referred to as the "Father of the Computer"
- Babbage conceptualized the **Analytical Engine**, a design for a mechanical, general-purpose computer
- His idea was groundbreaking as it introduced the concept of a programmable machine that could perform any calculation if given the correct instructions
- Although Babbage never completed the construction of the Analytical Engine due to technical and financial limitations, his design included many principles that are foundational to modern computing, such as control flow and memory

#### Ada Lovelace (1815 - 1852)
- Widely recognized as the "First Programmer"
- Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage and documented the Analytical Engine’s design and capabilities
- Lovelace wrote what is considered the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine which was to compute **Bernoulli numbers**
- She recognized the broader potential of the Analytical Engine, envisioning it as a machine that could go beyond mere calculations and eventually work with text, music, and other types of data
- Her foresight about the possibilities of computing extended far beyond her time, and she is celebrated as a visionary in the field of programming and computing

#### The Analytical Engine (proposed 1837, design refined until 1910)
- The Analytical Engine was designed as a mechanical computer, featuring many of the components seen in modern computers
  - **Mill**: This is analogous to the modern **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**, responsible for processing calculations and executing instructions
  - **Store**: Functions as **memory**, holding data and intermediate results during computation
  - **Reader/Printer**: Acts as **Input/Output (I/O)**, allowing information to be read into the machine and results to be printed out
- The design included an early form of **programming control flow** with conditional branching and looping, enabling it to execute complex calculations and perform multiple operations
- Although it was never built, the Analytical Engine’s conceptual framework deeply influenced the development of later computers, particularly with its use of punched cards for input and storage
