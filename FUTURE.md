# Future Ideas
_Considerations for future classes_

### ‚öôÔ∏è General

#### Use VSCode or a Related IDE
_...instaed of using Google Colab_

Colab is a great tool, but requiring students to download and use VSCode or a related IDE might be more in their favor since they learn actual processes and don't have to deal with Colab weirdness.

‚úÖ **Pros**
- Exposes students to professional development tools
- Encourages understanding of file systems and project structure
- Builds habits aligned with real-world engineering workflows
- Does not require Internet
- Avoids Colab-specific quirks and limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**
- Higher setup complexity and risk of configuration issues
- Potentially steep learning curve for beginners
- Less accessible on shared or limited-resource devices
- Harder to provide consistent support across diverse environments
- Major restructuing of current assignments

### ü•º Laboratories
Legacy Laboratory-like assignments felt like simply another homework and did not provide a valuable experience for students, as they noted multiple times in the Spring 2025 section. Legacy assignments are no longer valid since students now have the ability to compile and run code on their **required** machines. Previously, the only way to run code was with the machines provided in the computer labs which have since been removed. Below are ideas that could enhance the students' experiences in the lab:

#### Programming RPI
_...or related microcontroller_

Students would be assigned to small groups within their laboratory section, fostering collaboration and peer learning. Each week, these groups would tackle a different hands-on activity focused on a specific component of programming and interacting with a Raspberry Pi (RPi). Topics might include reading sensor data, controlling actuators, writing and debugging Python scripts, using GPIO pins, and integrating external libraries.

‚úÖ **Pros**
* Peer Learning and Collaboration
* Active, Hands-On Engagement
* Scaffolded Skill Building
* Alignment with Engineering Practice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**
- Uneven Participation
- Logistical Challenges
- Variable Group Dynamics
- Assessment Complexity
- Technical Troubleshooting Bottlenecks

#### Creating a Web App
Students might get more out of creating a Python-based web app from start-to-finish. They could leverage common libraries to build a web app where each of their laboratories would build upon each other.

‚úÖ **Pros**
  - Encourages modular, cumulative development skills
  - Provides a sense of continuity and ownership over a single project
  - Introduces practical web development concepts used in industry
  - Can integrate nicely with a personalized final project
  - Offers natural opportunities for learning about files, routes, functions, and interfaces

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**
  - Requires more scaffolding and setup early on
  - Can feel overwhelming if students fall behind
  - May shift focus away from core Python concepts toward web frameworks
  - Debugging web apps introduces complexity beyond basic scripts
  - Harder to vary topics week-to-week without feeling forced
