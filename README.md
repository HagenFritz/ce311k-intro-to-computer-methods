# Future Ideas
_Considerations for future classes_

### ⚙️ General


### 🥼 Laboratories
Legacy Laboratory-like assignments felt like simply another homework and did not provide a valuable experience for students, as they noted multiple times in the Spring 2025 section. Legacy assignments are no longer valid since students now have the ability to compile and run code on their **required** machines. Previously, the only way to run code was with the machines provided in the computer labs which have since been removed. Below are ideas that could enhance the students' experiences in the lab:

#### Programming RPI
_...or related microcontroller_

Students would be assigned to small groups within their laboratory section, fostering collaboration and peer learning. Each week, these groups would tackle a different hands-on activity focused on a specific component of programming and interacting with a Raspberry Pi (RPi). Topics might include reading sensor data, controlling actuators, writing and debugging Python scripts, using GPIO pins, and integrating external libraries.

✅ **Pros**
* Peer Learning and Collaboration
* Active, Hands-On Engagement
* Scaffolded Skill Building
* Alignment with Engineering Practice

⚠️ **Cons**
- Uneven Participation
- Logistical Challenges
- Variable Group Dynamics
- Assessment Complexity
- Technical Troubleshooting Bottlenecks

#### Creating a Web App
