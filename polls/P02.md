  1. Create an integer `grade` and set it equal to 82
  2. Create a str `letter` and set it equal to "F"
  3. Use an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement to update the value of `letter`:

  The Universal Law of Gravitation is given by:
  #### $F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}$

  1. Define each of these variables in python with the following values:
      * $G=6.674\times 10^{-11}\ N \cdot m^2/kg^2$
      * $m_1 = 10\ kg$
      * $m_2 = 20\ kg$
      * $r=2\ m$
  2. Write the arithmetic expression with these variables, storing the result into `F`
  3. Output `F` (don't use a `print()` statement)
