  1. Create a function called `count_even_numbers()` that takes one `list` input called `numbers`
  2. Within the function, create a variable called `even_count` and initialize it with a value of 0
  3. Loop through each number and use an if-statement to check if the number is even. If so, increment `even_count` by 1
  4. Return `even_count`
  5. Call your function with the following `list` of `int`: [1, 2, 4, 7]

  1. Create a function called `is_contaminated()` that takes two input parameters:
      1. `concentration` : int or float
      2. `limit` : int or float
  2. In your function, create a variable `contaminated` and initialize it with a value of `False`
  3. Within your function, write an `if` statement checking if `concentration` is greater than `limit`
      * if so, set `contaminated` equal to `True`
    
  4. At the end of your function, `return` your value of `contaminated`
  5. Outside your function, create a `for`-loop that traverses these values: [0.1, 0.2, 0.5]
  6. Within your loop, call `is_contaminated()` with the value for the current loop and a limit of 0.3
  7. Within the loop, `print()` out the result from `is_contaminated()`

  1. Create a list of air quality measurements called `readings` with the following values: 24, 42, 50, 13
  2. Use a `for`-loop to loop through each `reading` in `readings`
  3. Within your loop, create a variable called `first_unhealthy` and set it equal to the current reading
  4. Use an `if` statement within the loop to check if `reading` is greater than 35
     * if so, use a `break` to exit the loop
  5. Outside the loop, print the value of `first_unhealthy`
