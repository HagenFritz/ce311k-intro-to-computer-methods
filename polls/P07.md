  Create a list of two dictionaries `data` that contain two key-value pairs:
  * "city": string city name - use any two cities
  * "pm2.5": float measurement - use one value below 35 and one above 35

  Use either a traditional loop or list comprehension approach to create a new list variable `results` that contains dictionary entries in `data` where the "pm2.5" value is above 35

  Create a variable `water_levels` that is a list of of two strings with similar data as below:
  ```python
  2025-03-01, 2.54
  2025-03-02, 2.60
  ```

  Loop through each entry in your list and use the `strip()` method to pull out the date and float value. Create a dictionary with these parsed values and store them in a list so that you get the following result:
  ```python
  [
    {"date": "2025-03-01", "level": 2.54},
    {"date": "2025-03-02", "level": 2.60}
  ]
  ```

  Create a Python function called `quadratic` that takes four parameters below and returns the calculation of $ax^2 + bx + c$:
   - `x` : float, value to evaluate the function at
   - `a`: float, coefficient for $x^2$ term
   - `b`: float, coefficient for $x$ term
   - `c`: float, constant value

  Import the `numpy` library and use the `linspace()` method to generate 20 points evenly spaced between 0 and 10 and store the result in a variables `xs`
  
  Use a loop or list comprehension with your `quadratic()` function to create a new list `ys` that contains the results from the equation `2x^2 + 1` evaluated at each value in `xs`
