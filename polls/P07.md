  Create a list of two dictionaries `data` that contain two key-value pairs:
  * "city": string city name - use any two cities
  * "pm2.5": float measurement - use one value below 35 and one above 35

  Use list comprehension to filter `data` for dictionary entries where the "pm2.5" value is above 35
  * store the result in a new variable
  * print() or output the variable

  Create a variable `water_levels` that is a list of of two strings with similar data as below:
  ```python
  2025-03-01, 2.54
  2025-03-02, 2.60
  ```

  Loop through each entry in your list and use the `strip()` method to pull out the date and float value. Create a dictionary with these prased values and store them in a list so that you get the following result:
  ```python
  [
    {"date": "2025-03-01", "level": 2.54},
    {"date": "2025-03-02", "level": 2.60}
  ]
  ```

  4. Use another f-string to  print both values again using one `print()` statement
