  Clean and parse the data
  1. Create two empty lists: one for depth values (`depths`) and one for temperature values (`temperatures`)

  3. Check if the "temp_C" value is not an empty string ("")
  4. If itâ€™s valid,
     * append the float-casted "depth_m" value to `depths`
     * append the float-casted "temp_C" value to `temperatures`
