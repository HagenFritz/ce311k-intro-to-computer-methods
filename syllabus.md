### Attendance
Regular **in-person** attendance in both lectures and labs is expected, but is not required and will no be counted toward your final grade. No virtual option will be provided. Students are​ ​expected to attend all class and laboratory periods​.​ Those who fail to attend class and laboratory regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. ​If you plan to miss an an assignment or need an extension due to the observance of a religious holiday or a similar extenuating circumstance, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if applicable. For further information check here: [http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/](http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/).

### Course Assignments
Homework and laboratory assignments will generally be assigned each week. Homework assignments will be assigned on Mondays at 12:00 pm immediately following lecture and will be due the following Monday at 11:00 am. Laboratory assignments will be provided an hour before your schedule section and be due by 11:59 pm the night before your section. A ​digital copy​ must be submitted via Canvas to facilitate grading. Late assignments will receive a 10% penalty per day, up to 10 days late.

### Course Examinations 
There will be two exams given during the regularly scheduled lecture period. In addition to the material covered in the class lectures, the exams may include questions from your work in the laboratory portion of the class. Exams for this course will be conducted online and will focus on evaluating your understanding of core programming concepts and problem-solving skills. The exams will _not_ test perfect syntax or require you to write code by hand. Instead, you will be asked to:
* Explain concepts and demonstrate your understanding of how various programming techniques apply to engineering problems.
* Analyze and debug code: You will be given pre-written Python code to identify bugs or inefficiencies and suggest improvements.
* Solve real-world problems: You will outline logical approaches to solve engineering-related problems, focusing on problem-solving rather than specific syntax.

You are allowed to use programming resources, including AI tools, textbooks, and online references. However, the questions are designed to assess your deeper understanding, so simply copying code will not suffice.

### Course Project
No final exam will be scheduled for this course. Instead, you will complete an indvidual final project. The final project is an opportunity for you to apply the programming skills and problem-solving techniques learned throughout the course to real problems. You will have two options for completing the project:
1. **Predefined Problem**: You will be provided with a multi-part engineering problem that requires you to develop a Python program to solve it.
2. **Custom Project**: You may propose a project of your own design, which must be approved by the instructor. This project must demonstrate the application of Python programming to solve a practical problem.

The project will be completed individually, and you will submit both your code and brief documentation explaining your approach and the results. Your project should include well-structured, readable code that solves the problem effectively. It should demonstrate your ability to implement the programming and problem-solving techniques discussed in class.

Projects are due _at midnight_ on the date of our course's final exam date. You can find the final exam schedule here:[https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/242/finals](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/242/finals). 

### Student 

### Academic Integrity 
Sharing of course materials is prohibited. No materials used in this class, including but not limited to lecture handouts, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating, violates the University’s Student Honor Code, and constitutes academic dishonesty. Any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.You are responsible for understanding [UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code](http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/).

Students are strongly encouraged to discuss course topics among themselves, but all work submitted for this class ​must​ be entirely your own. This requirement will be strictly enforced for all assignments. In doing class assignments, you may consult with your fellow classmates regarding the most appropriate solution to a given problem. However, ​each student must prepare his or her own, individual submission for each assignment​. ​Identical copies of scripts or data plots are not acceptable​. 

### Class Recordings
Class recordings are reserved for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

### Course and Instructor Evaluation 
Formal evaluations of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using UT’s official evaluation forms. However, I encourage you to share feedback and suggestions for improving the course content or instruction at any time. If something isn’t working for you, please feel free to reach out - I’m committed to fostering an open dialogue and helping everyone succeed.
