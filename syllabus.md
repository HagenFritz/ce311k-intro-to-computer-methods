### Course Description
Welcome! CE 311K introduces Python programming and computational methods for solving problems in civil, architectural, and environmental engineering. Students will develop problem-solving skills through structured programming, data manipulation, and basic numerical methods applied to a wide range of engineering problems.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will:
1. Develop Python programs to solve engineering problems across civil, architectural, and environmental disciplines.
2. Analyze and manipulate data using Python for engineering applications.
3. Understand basic computational algorithms and their efficiency in solving real-world problems.
4. Apply numerical methods for solving problems in various engineering contexts.

### Prerequisites
* **Prerequisite**: Credit or registration for Mathematics 408D or M 308L; additional prerequisite for civil engineering majors, Civil Engineering 301.
* **Recommended Background**: Basic knowledge of mathematical functions, algebra, and familiarity with engineering concepts. No prior programming experience is required.

### Course Materials
* **Textbook**: No formal textbook is required for this course.
* **Online Resources**: Python is widely popular and there are _many_ resources out there.
* **Google Colab**: We will be using [Colab](https://colab.google/) for all assignments this semester. You are not expected to have prior knowledge of this programming environment and we will help set you all up at the beginning of the semester.

### Grading Breakdown
- **Homework (15%)**: Broader concepts and smaller-scale coding problems to reinforce programming fundamentals and provide additional practice.
- **Lab Assignments (40%)**: Weekly lab exercises that directly apply programming to solve engineering problems, reinforcing lecture topics.
- **Exams (25%)**: Two exams focused on assessing students’ understanding of core programming concepts and their ability to apply them.
- **Final Project (20%)**: Students will demonstrate their programming skills by solving either (1) a predefined, multipart engineering problem or (2) a project of their choosing (subject to instructor approval).

### Attendance
Regular **in-person** attendance in both lectures and labs is expected. No virtual option will be provided. Students are​ ​expected to attend all class and laboratory periods​.​ Those who fail to attend class and 
laboratory regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. ​If you plan to miss class due to the observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if 
applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements. For further information check [here](http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/).

### Course Assignments
Homework and laboratory assignments will generally be assigned each week and will be due at midnight on the date specified. A ​digital copy​ must be submitted via Canvas to facilitate grading. Late assignments will receive a 10% penalty per day, up to 5 days late. After midnight on the fifth day, you will not be able to receive credit.

### Course Examinations 
There will be two exams given during the regularly scheduled lecture period. In addition to the material covered in the class lectures, the exams may include questions from your work in the laboratory portion of the class. Exams for this course will be conducted online and will focus on evaluating your understanding of core programming concepts and problem-solving skills. The exams will _not_ test perfect syntax or require you to write code by hand. Instead, you will be asked to:
* Explain concepts and demonstrate your understanding of how various programming techniques apply to engineering problems.
* Analyze and debug code: You will be given pre-written Python code to identify bugs or inefficiencies and suggest improvements.
* Solve real-world problems: You will outline logical approaches to solve engineering-related problems, focusing on problem-solving rather than specific syntax.

You are allowed to use programming resources, including AI tools, textbooks, and online references. However, the questions are designed to assess your deeper understanding, so simply copying code will not suffice.

### Course Project
The final project is an opportunity for you to apply the programming skills and problem-solving techniques learned throughout the course to real problems. You will have two options for completing the project:
1. **Predefined Problem**: You will be provided with a multi-part engineering problem that requires you to develop a Python program to solve it.
2. **Custom Project**: You may propose a project of your own design, which must be approved by the instructor. This project must demonstrate the application of Python programming to solve a practical problem.

The project will be completed individually, and you will submit both your code and brief documentation explaining your approach and the results. Your project should include well-structured, readable code that solves the problem effectively. It should demonstrate your ability to implement the programming and problem-solving techniques discussed in class.

Projects are due _at midnight_ on the date of our course's final exam date. You can find the final exam schedule [here](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/242/finals). 

### Academic Integrity 
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code.​ ​Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. If you use words or ideas that are not your own, you must cite your sources. Otherwise, you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action. You are responsible for understanding [UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code](http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/).

Students are strongly encouraged to discuss course topics among themselves, but all work submitted for this class ​must​ be entirely your own. This requirement will be strictly enforced for all assignments. In doing class assignments, you may consult with your fellow classmates regarding the most appropriate solution to a given problem. However, ​each student must prepare his or her own, individual submission for each assignment​. ​Identical copies of scripts or data plots are not acceptable​. 

### Course and Instructor Evaluation 
Formal evaluations of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using UT’s official evaluation forms. However, I encourage you to share feedback and suggestions for improving the course content or instruction at any time. If something isn’t working for you, please feel free to reach out - I’m committed to fostering an open dialogue and helping everyone succeed.

### Statement on Disability and Accessibility
The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Disability and Access (D&A). Please refer to D&A’s website for contact and more information: http://disability.utexas.edu/. If you are already registered with D&A , please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.
