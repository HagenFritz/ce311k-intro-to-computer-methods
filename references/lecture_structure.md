# Typical Lecture Structure (50 minutes)

1. **Introduction (5–10 minutes)**:
   - **Recap**: Review key points from the previous lecture to create continuity.
   - **Objectives**: Clearly state the goals for the day’s lecture so the focus is established.

2. **Conceptual Overview (10–15 minutes)**:
   - **Core Concepts**: Introduce new topics with a conceptual explanation, using simple language and real-world engineering examples.
   - **Examples**: Give at least one high-level example of how the concept applies to CAEE.

3. **Interactive Demonstration (10–15 minutes)**:
   - **Live Coding**: Use live coding to illustrate the core concept in practice. Walk through the code step-by-step to show how the programming elements work together.
   - **Student Q&A**: Pause periodically to invite questions or clarifications to keep the session interactive.

4. **Guided Practice (10–15 minutes)**:
   - **Small Coding Problem**: Present a simple problem related to the day’s topic and let the students work through it in real-time.
   - **Discussion**: Discuss common approaches and solutions. This will help clarify any misunderstandings and give students a sense of progress.

5. **Wrap-Up and Preview (5 minutes)**:
   - **Summary**: Review the key takeaways of the lecture and tie them back to the learning objectives.
   - **Next Lecture Preview**: Give a short preview of what’s coming in the next lecture.
