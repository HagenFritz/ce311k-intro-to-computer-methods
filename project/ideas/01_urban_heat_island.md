## Project 1: Urban Heat Island Effect Analysis

#### **Project Overview**:
The **Urban Heat Island Effect** refers to the phenomenon where urban areas experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings, primarily due to human activities and environmental modifications (e.g., buildings, roads, and reduced vegetation). In this project, students will create a tool to analyze temperature differences between urban and surrounding rural areas, visualize the temperature gradient, and explore how urbanization influences local climates. By using forecast data provided by the OpenWeatherMap 5-day forecast API, students will analyze the extent of the Urban Heat Island Effect across cities with different climate zones.

#### **Objective**:
Students will gather forecasted temperature data for selected urban areas from different climates and their surrounding rural areas. The goal is to visualize temperature disparities, explore the correlation between temperature and factors such as urbanization, and investigate how different climates influence the severity of the Urban Heat Island Effect. Students will compare the temperature differences between urban and rural areas in cities that represent tropical, temperate, and desert climates.

#### **Focus Areas**:
- **Data Collection**: Use the OpenWeatherMap **5-day Forecast API** to gather forecasted temperature data for **three cities** representing different climate zones:
  1. **Tropical Climate** (e.g., cities near the equator with high humidity and temperatures)
  2. **Temperate Climate** (e.g., cities with moderate seasonal variation and temperatures)
  3. **Desert Climate** (e.g., cities with hot, dry summers and mild winters)
  
  For each city, students will compare the temperatures in the **urban area** and a nearby **rural area** over several days.
  
- **City Definitions**:
  - **Urban City**: Defined as a city with a population of **over 500,000** people. These cities have significant human development, infrastructure, and building density.
  - **Rural City**: Defined as a city with a population of **under 100,000** people. These cities have less dense development, more open land, and fewer urban features like large buildings or extensive transportation networks.

- **Climate Zones**:
  - **Tropical Climate**: Cities typically located near the equator with high temperatures year-round and significant rainfall. Example: **Houston, Texas**.
  - **Temperate Climate**: Cities with moderate seasonal changes, cooler winters, and warm summers. Example: **Austin, Texas**.
  - **Desert Climate**: Cities with very hot summers and mild winters, characterized by low rainfall. Example: **El Paso, Texas**.

- **Data Analysis**: 
   - Calculate the **temperature difference** between urban and rural areas for each of the three cities (tropical, temperate, desert).
   - Explore how urban features contribute to the heat island effect and how local climate conditions influence the severity of the effect.

- **Climate Comparison**: Compare the extent of the Urban Heat Island effect across the three cities and analyze how different climate zones influence the intensity of the effect.

- **Visualization**: Create visualizations that show the temperature gradient over multiple days. Use line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps to compare urban and rural temperatures in each of the cities.

#### **Data Sources**:
- **OpenWeatherMap 5-day Forecast API**:
  - Use this API to retrieve **forecasted temperature data** for the urban and rural areas over the next five days. This data will help students analyze temperature trends and fluctuations in the selected cities.

#### **Project Requirements**:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Use the OpenWeatherMap **5-day Forecast API** to fetch forecasted temperature data for **three cities** representing tropical, temperate, and desert climates.
   - For each city, compare the temperature data for the urban area (population over 500,000) and a nearby rural area (population under 100,000).

2. **Analysis**:
   - Calculate the **temperature difference** between the urban and rural areas in each of the three cities.
   - Identify any significant disparities that indicate a strong Urban Heat Island effect.
   - Explore how **local climate** (tropical, temperate, desert) influences the severity of the Urban Heat Island effect.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the temperature differences for each city using line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps to show how urban and rural temperatures compare over time.
   - Include a time-based visualization showing how temperatures fluctuate throughout the forecasted period.
