### **Proposal Requirements**

#### **Option 1: Provided Project**

1. **Major Questions**  
   Directly answer each project’s “Major Questions” in your proposal (these will be listed in the Provided Project description).

2. **Approach**  
   Outline a rough plan (flowchart, bullet points, etc.) for how you expect to solve it. Feel free to “whiteboard” your approach and include a photo.  
   - It’s **okay** if you aren’t 100% certain yet or if you need to adjust your approach later on.

3. **Length**  
   Minimum one page in length. Maximum two pages.

> **Important**: You **do not** need to write a separate problem statement. The Provided Project description already covers that. Just answer the Major Questions and give a brief sense of your approach.

#### **Option 2: Custom Project**

If you’d like to propose your own topic instead of doing a Provided Project:

1. **Problem Statement**  
   Summarize the problem or topic you want to explore.

2. **Project Goals**  
   What exactly do you plan to accomplish?

3. **Approach**  
   Outline a rough plan (flowchart, bullet points, etc.) for how you expect to solve it. Feel free to “whiteboard” your approach and include a photo.  
   - It’s **okay** if you aren’t 100% certain yet or if you need to adjust your approach later on.

4. **Expected Outcomes**  
   What do you think you’ll learn or produce?

5. **Meeting with Instructor**  
   Since this path is more open-ended, you _will_ need to meet _virtually_ with your instructor to discuss your proposal and get the go-ahead.
   - **Please include THREE options for a 30-minute meeting in your submission (use the textbox or a comment)**. Your meeting time should be any time between when you submit your proposal and April 21st.
   - In addition to normal office hours, the instructor will have _increased_ availability during this time period and will schedule a Zoom meeting with you based on one of your provided times.

### **Submission**
1. Please provide a **single** document to Canvas that includes all of the above requirements. You can use a Markdown file, a PDF, or a Word document.
2. Your document should be professional and well-organized - use clear headers, bullet points, and subheadings. You may include photos of your thought process but make sure they are clear and easy to interpret.
3. Take your time, but don't overthink it. This process is meant to help you get your thoughts organized and prepare you actually crafting the project.
4. [Optional] Don't forget to include meeting times for custom projects.

  - If it is appropriate, you will receive a confirmation that you can proceed.
