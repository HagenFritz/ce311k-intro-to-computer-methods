# CE 311K: Final Project Overview

#### **Project Overview**:
The final project provides students with an opportunity to apply the programming and problem-solving techniques learned throughout the semester. Students will select or be given a predefined engineering-related problem, and they will develop a Python-based solution. The project will involve data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, as well as demonstrating the use of essential Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, error handling, and file I/O.

#### **Timeline**:
- **April 7th-14th**: Students submit a one-page project proposal.
- **April 14th-21st**: Instructor provides feedback or meets with students to discuss their project and give greenlight approval.
- **April 21st-May 1st**: Students will begin working on their project.
- **Final Submission**: Due on the last day of the course. The submission will include:
  - A **Colab notebook** containing the full project code and analysis.
  - A **PDF copy** of the Colab notebook, which includes the required report content.

#### **Project Proposal**:
Each student must submit a **one-page project proposal** by April 14th. The proposal should outline:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem they are solving (e.g., environmental data analysis, civil engineering simulations, etc.).
- **Project Goals**: Specific objectives they intend to achieve (e.g., generating visualizations, automating calculations, performing data analysis).
- **Approach**: A high-level overview of how they will solve the problem (e.g., methods, techniques, and Python libraries they plan to use).
- **Expected Outcomes**: What they hope to demonstrate or achieve by the end of the project.

### **Required Deliverables**:
1. **Colab Notebook**: This should be the main part of the project submission. The notebook must include:
   - Clear, well-documented Python code.
   - Step-by-step analysis and data processing (including necessary imports, functions, and libraries).
   - Visualization of data using Python plotting libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
   
2. **PDF Copy**: A PDF document of the Colab notebook that includes the following:
   - **Project Goals**: This should be a copy-paste from the proposal.
   - **Libraries Used**: A list of Python libraries or tools used, similar to a `requirements.txt` file.
   - **Visualization**: At least one required visualization of the data or results (e.g., graphs, charts).
   - **Short Write-up on Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned**: A brief reflection on the challenges encountered during the project, how they were overcome, and what was learned from the experience.

### **Programming Requirements**:
The final project must include the following programming features:

1. **Two Python Functions**:
   - Each function must include a **clear docstring** explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.
   
2. **Code Modularity**:
   - The code should not be written as one large code block. It must be broken into multiple functions or sections for better readability and structure.
   
3. **File I/O**:
   - The project must either **read from a file** (e.g., CSV) or **save data to a file** (e.g., results or processed data).

4. **In-text Comments**:
   - At least **10 in-text comments** throughout the code explaining key steps, logic, or parts of the program.

5. **Loop**:
   - The project must use **at least one loop** (this can include list comprehension).

6. **Conditional**:
   - The project must include **at least one conditional** statement (e.g., `if/else`).

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Proper **error handling** should be included (e.g., handling missing or invalid data, file I/O errors, etc.).

---

### **Grading Criteria**:
- **Code Quality (40%)**: Well-structured, modular code with clear documentation and error handling.
- **Functionality (30%)**: The code must solve the problem effectively, producing accurate and meaningful results.
- **Report/Analysis (20%)**: A well-written, clear report that includes the required sections and demonstrates the project’s outcomes.
- **Creativity/Complexity (10%)**: The project’s innovation, complexity, and any extra features or improvements implemented beyond the basic requirements.

---

### **Support and Guidance**:
- **Proposal Feedback**: After the proposal submission (April 14th-21st), students will receive feedback or be invited to meet with the instructor for further discussion.
- **Office Hours**: Students are encouraged to attend office hours for additional help during the project’s development phase.
- **Progress Check-in**: Students will provide a progress update from April 14th-21st to ensure they are on track and have received necessary guidance.
